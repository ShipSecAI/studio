# OpenSearch Security - Tenants Configuration (SaaS Model)
#
# TENANT ISOLATION STRATEGY:
# Each customer gets their own isolated tenant and index pattern.
# No shared/global dashboards - sharing is explicitly opt-in.
#
# Tenants are created dynamically via the Security REST API when
# a new customer is onboarded. Tenant name = customer ID.
#
# Index naming convention: {customer_id}-analytics-*
# Each customer's role restricts access to only their indices.
#
# Example dynamic tenant creation (via backend):
#   POST /_plugins/_security/api/tenants/{customer_id}
#   { "description": "Tenant for customer {customer_id}" }
