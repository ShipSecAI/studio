# Development Ports Overlay
#
# WARNING: These ports bypass ALL nginx authentication!
# Use ONLY for local development where direct OpenSearch/Dashboards access is needed.
#
# Usage:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.infra.yml -f docker-compose.dev-ports.yml up -d
#
# This overlay exposes OpenSearch and Dashboards ports on loopback (127.0.0.1) only,
# preventing external network access while allowing local development tools to connect.
