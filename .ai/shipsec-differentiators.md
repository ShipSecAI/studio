# ShipSec Studio Differentiators (vs existing recon/SOAR tools)

- **Recon-first UX**: Blocks/inspectors tailored to ProjectDiscovery + bounty workflows (not generic SOC playbooks).
- **Temporal reliability**: Long-running scans survive restarts, retries managed automatically—rare outside Tracecat-like platforms.
- **Marketplace flywheel**: Community modules for CLI tools, enrichers, notification connectors with version pinning.
- **Hybrid authoring**: Drag nodes or drop into TypeScript/Python transforms with typed inputs/outputs.
- **Asset intelligence loop**: Track domain → subdomain → service changes over time with diffs and alerts.
- **Fast iteration**: Ability to wrap new scanners/template packs quickly; community feedback flows into templates.
- **Targeted glue**: Automate Slack, Jira, report drafting, HackerOne submissions directly in the workflow.
