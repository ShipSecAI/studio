## What is ShipSec Studio?

ShipSec Studio is an **open-source, no-code security workflow orchestration platform**. Build, execute, and monitor security automation workflows through a visual canvas — focus on security logic, not infrastructure plumbing.

## Core Subsystems

These are the most complex parts of the system — each has its own dedicated deep-dive:

## Component Categories

Components are the drag-and-drop building blocks of every workflow.

| Category          | What it does                      | Examples                                                |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **security**      | Security scanning and enumeration | Subfinder, DNSX, Nuclei, Naabu, HTTPx, TruffleHog       |
| **ai**            | AI/LLM and agent components       | LLM Generate, AI Agent, MCP Providers                   |
| **core**          | Utility and data processing       | HTTP Request, File Loader, Logic Script, JSON Transform |
| **notification**  | Alerts and messaging              | Slack, Email                                            |
| **manual-action** | Human-in-the-loop controls        | Approvals, Forms, Selection                             |
| **github**        | GitHub integrations               | Remove Org Membership                                   |

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Multi-tenancy

- **Clerk Integration** — Production-ready auth for hosted deployments
- **Local Auth** — Default for local dev via `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env vars
- **Organization Isolation** — Every database record is scoped by `organization_id` — no data leaks between tenants

### Secrets Management

- **AES-256-GCM** encryption for all secrets at rest
- **Versioned secrets** with active/inactive state tracking
- **Master key** provided via the `SECRET_STORE_MASTER_KEY` environment variable

### Container Isolation

- **IsolatedContainerVolume** — Each workflow run gets a dedicated, per-tenant Docker volume
- **Network isolation** — Components execute with `network: none` or `bridge` depending on requirements
- **Automatic cleanup** — Volumes are destroyed immediately after execution completes

<Note>
  For a full breakdown of isolated volume behavior, see the [Isolated Volumes](/development/isolated-volumes) guide.

## Development URLs

All services are accessible through **nginx on port 80** in development:

| Service          | URL                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| Frontend         | http://localhost/           |
| Backend API      | http://localhost/api/       |
| Analytics        | http://localhost/analytics/ |
| Temporal UI      | http://localhost:8081       |
| MinIO Console    | http://localhost:9001       |
| Redpanda Console | http://localhost:8082       |
| Loki             | http://localhost:3100       |

<Note>
  Direct service ports (`5173`, `3211`, `5601`) are available for low-level debugging only. All normal development traffic should flow through nginx on port 80.
