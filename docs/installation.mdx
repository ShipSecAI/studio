## What You'll Need

Before installing, make sure you have these tools ready on your machine:

- **Docker Desktop** — with at least **8 GB RAM** allocated _(Settings → Resources → Memory)_
- **[Bun](https://bun.sh)** — a fast JavaScript runtime (replaces Node.js)
- **[just](https://github.com/casey/just)** — a simple command runner (like `make`, but friendlier)
- **Open ports** — the following ports must be free on your machine:

  `5433` · `7233` · `8081` · `9000` · `9001` · `3100`

<Tip>
  On macOS, install Bun and just instantly with Homebrew:
```bash
  brew install bun just
```
</Tip>

## Installation Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository & initialize">
    This downloads the ShipSec Studio source code to your machine and runs a one-time setup script.
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shipsecai/studio.git
    cd studio
    just init
```

    `just init` does three things automatically:
    - Installs all project dependencies using Bun
    - Creates your environment config files (`backend/.env`, `worker/.env`, `frontend/.env`)

    <Note>
      **macOS users:** If you see native module errors during `just init`, run this first, then retry:
```bash
      export SDKROOT=$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)
      bun install
```
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your environment">
    Open and edit the generated config files to match your setup. For most users, **the defaults work out of the box** — you only need to change these if you have custom infrastructure.
```bash
    nano backend/.env
    nano worker/.env
    nano frontend/.env
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the development environment">
    One command starts everything:
```bash
    just dev
```

    Behind the scenes, this automatically:
    - Verifies your environment files exist
    - Launches all Docker services (Postgres, Temporal, MinIO, Loki)
    - Waits for each service to become healthy
    - Runs database migrations
    - Starts the backend, worker, and frontend — all with **hot-reload** (changes reflect instantly)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open ShipSec Studio">
    Once everything is running, open your browser and go to:

    **[http://localhost](http://localhost)**

    Sign in or create a new account to get started.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Service Endpoints

> Think of these as the "addresses" for each piece of the system. In development, almost everything runs through a single gateway (nginx) on port 80 — so you rarely need to memorize these.

| Service | URL | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | [http://localhost/](http://localhost/) | The main workflow builder UI |
| Backend API | [http://localhost/api/](http://localhost/api/) | The REST API powering the app |
| Analytics | [http://localhost/analytics/](http://localhost/analytics/) | OpenSearch Dashboards (visualizations) |
| Temporal UI | [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) | Inspect running/completed workflows |
| PostgreSQL | `localhost:5433` | The main database |
| MinIO | [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) | File/object storage |
| MinIO Console | [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) | Storage UI — login: `minioadmin / minioadmin` |
| Loki | `localhost:3100` | Log aggregation |

<Note>
  Direct ports like `5173` (frontend) and `3211` (backend) exist for deep debugging only. For all normal development, use **port 80 via nginx** — it handles routing automatically.
</Note>

## Analytics Stack (Optional)

ShipSec Studio ships with a built-in analytics layer powered by **OpenSearch** — useful for indexing, searching, and visualizing your workflow execution data over time.

<Info>
  This is completely optional. If you skip this section, everything else still works perfectly. The Analytics Sink component will simply log a warning and skip indexing if OpenSearch isn't configured.
</Info>

### Starting the Analytics Services
```bash
just infra up
```

This starts:
- **OpenSearch** on port `9200` — the search and analytics engine
- **OpenSearch Dashboards** on port `5601` — the visual query and dashboard UI

### Configuring Analytics

Add these variables to your `backend/.env` and `worker/.env` files:
```bash
# backend/.env and worker/.env
OPENSEARCH_URL=http://localhost:9200
OPENSEARCH_USERNAME=admin
OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD=admin
OPENSEARCH_DASHBOARDS_URL=http://localhost/analytics
```
```bash
# frontend/.env
VITE_OPENSEARCH_DASHBOARDS_URL=http://localhost/analytics
```

### Setting Up the Index Template

Run this once after OpenSearch is up. It creates the data structure for storing security findings:
```bash
cd backend
bun run setup:opensearch
```

This creates a `security-findings-*` index template with the correct field mappings.

### Using Analytics in Workflows

Once configured, you can use analytics in three ways:

- **Analytics Sink Component** — drag it into any workflow to automatically index output data
- **OpenSearch Dashboards** — accessible from the Studio sidebar for building visualizations
- **Query API** — call `/api/analytics/query` to query indexed data from your own scripts or tools

---

## Production Deployment

When you're ready to move beyond development and run ShipSec Studio in a live environment:
```bash
# Start using pre-built (cached) images — fastest option
just prod

# Rebuild images from scratch, then start
just prod build
```

Production exposes the same URLs as development — all routed through nginx on port 80:

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Frontend | http://localhost/ |
| Backend API | http://localhost/api/ |
| Analytics | http://localhost/analytics/ |
| Temporal UI | http://localhost:8081 |

## Command Reference

A quick cheat sheet for the most common operations. Don't worry about memorizing all of these — `just dev` and `just dev stop` cover 90% of daily use.

### Development
```bash
just dev           # Start the full development environment
just dev stop      # Stop everything cleanly
just dev logs      # Stream live application logs
just dev status    # Check which services are running
just dev clean     # Stop everything and wipe all local data
```

### Production
```bash
just prod          # Start production (uses cached images)
just prod build    # Rebuild images and start
just prod stop     # Stop production environment
just prod logs     # Stream production logs
just prod status   # Check production service health
just prod clean    # Wipe all production data
```

### Infrastructure Only
```bash
just infra up      # Start only the Docker services (DB, storage, etc.)
just infra down    # Stop infrastructure services
just infra logs    # View infrastructure-level logs
just infra clean   # Remove all infrastructure data volumes
```

### Utilities
```bash
just status        # Overview of all running services
just db-reset      # ⚠️ Wipe and reset the database completely
just build         # Build Docker images without starting them
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="macOS: Native module build errors">
    This happens when Bun can't find the macOS SDK. Fix it by pointing Bun to the right SDK path:
```bash
    export SDKROOT=$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)
    bun install
```

    Then re-run `just init`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Services won't start">
    Check what's running and restart cleanly:
```bash
    just dev status

    # If something looks stuck:
    just dev stop
    just dev
```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Database connection failed">
    Run migrations manually and inspect the database logs:
```bash
    bun run migrate
    just infra logs
```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="PM2 processes keep failing">
    Usually caused by missing `.env` files. Check they exist, then restart:
```bash
    ls -la */.env      # Verify all three .env files exist

    just dev stop
    just dev

    just dev logs      # Watch for errors on startup
```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Frontend not loading in browser">
    Check if the dev server is running, and start it manually if needed:
```bash
    just dev status

    # Start frontend manually if it's missing:
    bun --cwd frontend dev
```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Temporal namespace missing error">
    Run the Temporal setup container to create the required namespace:
```bash
    docker compose -p shipsec --profile setup up -d
```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Nothing is working — full clean rebuild">
    The nuclear option. This wipes everything and starts from scratch:
```bash
    just dev stop
    just infra clean
    just infra up
    bun run migrate
    just dev
```

    <Warning>
      `just infra clean` deletes all local data including your database. Only use this if you're okay losing your local data.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Manual Setup (Advanced)

If you need granular control and want to start services individually rather than using `just dev`:

### Infrastructure only
```bash
just infra up     # Start Postgres, Temporal, MinIO, Loki
just status       # Confirm everything is healthy
just infra logs   # Watch infrastructure logs
```

### Applications only (after infrastructure is running)
```bash
pm2 start pm2.config.cjs   # Start backend, worker, and frontend via PM2
pm2 status                 # Check process health
pm2 logs                   # Stream logs from all processes
```
