title: "Quickstart"
description: "Get ShipSec Studio running in 5 minutes."
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker Desktop** — with at least 8 GB RAM allocated
- **[Bun](https://bun.sh)** — JavaScript runtime & package manager
- **[just](https://github.com/casey/just)** — command runner

<Tip>
  On macOS, you can install both Bun and just via Homebrew: `brew install bun just`
</Tip>

## Quick Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone and initialize">
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shipsecai/studio.git
    cd studio
    just init
```

    `just init` installs all dependencies and scaffolds your environment files automatically — no manual `.env` configuration required.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the development environment">
```bash
    just dev
```

    This single command spins up the **full stack** — including Postgres, Temporal, MinIO, and Loki — runs database migrations, and launches all services with hot-reload enabled.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open ShipSec Studio">
    Navigate to [http://localhost](http://localhost) in your browser. Sign in with an existing account or create a new one to get started.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Access Points

All services are proxied through **nginx on port 80**. Use these URLs during development:

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Frontend | [http://localhost/](http://localhost/) |
| Backend API | [http://localhost/api/](http://localhost/api/) |
| Temporal UI | [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) |

<Note>
  Direct service ports (`5173` for the frontend, `3211` for the backend) are available for low-level debugging but should not be used for normal development workflows.
</Note>

## Your First Workflow

Build and run a **Subdomain Discovery** workflow in under a minute.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new workflow">
    From the dashboard, click **New Workflow** and name it `Subdomain Discovery`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build the canvas">
    - Drag a **Manual Trigger** onto the canvas
    - Drag a **Subfinder** component onto the canvas
    - Connect the trigger's output node to the Subfinder's input node
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run and observe">
    Click **Save**, then **Run**. Execution unfolds in real-time — watch streaming logs and live terminal output as your workflow runs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Common Commands
```bash
# Stream live logs
just dev logs

# Check service health
just dev status

# Stop all services
just dev stop

# Full restart
just dev stop && just dev
```
